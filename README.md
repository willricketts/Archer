# Archer

Voice-controller home automation system built on Node.js with help from the Google Speech API, and various third-party web services.

While an Archer server can run on pretty much any *nix system, an Archer worker requires both a microphone and speaker to operate.

Ideally, workers run on a Raspberry Pi with audio i/o in order to feed commands to an archer server.
